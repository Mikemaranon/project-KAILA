# Project KAI-os

`KAI-os` stands for `Kernel Artificial Intelligence Operating System`. This project is designed to progress through three robust phases with the ultimate goal of creating a network of Linux-based systems equipped with Machine Learning tools, enabling fully autonomous system administration.

The phases are as follows:  

- **KAIM (Kernel Artificial Intelligence Module)**: A kernel module that runs on every system within the network. This module will execute a streamlined and optimized model derived from `DeepSeek-R1`, specializing in system analysis to optimize processes based on the system’s intended purpose.

- **AILA (Artificial Intelligence Linux Administrator)**: A user-level LLM that receives input from all possible processes detected from the user’s interactions. AILA will have the autonomy to generate and execute new processes through the terminal, performing any commands a user could. It will maintain direct communication with `KAIM` to generate reports on user-experienced issues (such as crashes, long wait times, etc.), which will then be sent to `KAIM`. With access to all core system processes, `KAIM` will analyze the problem in depth and generate a detailed report with findings and recommendations for `AILA`.

- **SONA (System Orchestrator Network Agent)**: A variant of `AILA` that serves as an orchestrator within a local network composed of `KAI-os` distributions. This orchestrator will have the capability to manage the entire network, regardless of its structure, by controlling the permissions of each `AILA` instance (or even disabling unnecessary ones—for example, two clustered KAI-os systems with only one active `AILA` instance). This will enable the simulation of a network fully administered by artificial intelligence.
