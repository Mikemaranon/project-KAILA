# KAI: An AI powered Linux Kernel

This project has the main purpose of developing a linux distribution from the open-source kernel `linux-source`
in which i am going to introduce a new module that hosts a SLM purposely trained to help the user optimyze
the system, creating a new comand called `aikm` with a list of parameters for a better interaction between the
module and the user.

the final objective is simple: having a new distribution that can use the module to effectively know every single
problem and troubleshoots it in the moment. To ensure the intregrity of the system, the model will only have reading 
rights, although and the administrator can give it some temporal writing rights if necessary
