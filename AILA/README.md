# AILA: The KAIM-based Linux Agent  

`AILA` (Artificial Intelligence Linux Agent) is a prototype system. Since the `KAIM` project has some limitations due to its native execution in the kernel, `AILA` will serve as an additional user-based agent powered by a stronger LLM, optimizing recommendations from `KAIM` and applying its own independent assessments where necessary.  

Additionally, `AILA` will be used to serve further research in system administration. It is designed to be a fully independent administrator, eliminating the need for human supervision while possessing all the necessary knowledge to manage, monitor, and optimize the entire system autonomously. By continuously analyzing system performance through `KAIM`, `AILA` will detect potential issues and apply optimizations in real-time based on predefined policies and learned behaviors.  

Furthermore, `AILA` will act as an intermediary between users and `KAIM`, facilitating high-level interactions and providing detailed reports, recommendations, and automated troubleshooting. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, `AILA` will adapt to different environments, making it a versatile tool for system administration across various infrastructures.  

> **Summary**:  
> The goal of `AILA` is to push the boundaries of autonomous system management, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven administration in complex computing environments.
