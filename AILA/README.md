# AILA: The KAIM based Linux Agent 
`AILA` (Artificial Inteligence Linux Agent) is a prototype system. Since the `KAIM` project has some limitations due to the native execution in the kernel, `AILA` will serve as an aditional User-based Agent powered by a stronger LLM that will optimize every recommendation sugested by `KAIM`.  

Additionally, `AILA` will be used to server further investigation in the Administration of a system. It will be trained to be a fully independent Administrator without needing human supervision, having all the knowledge needed to manage, monitor, and optimize the entire system autonomously. AILA will continuously analyze system performance through `KAIM`, detect potential issues, and apply optimizations in real-time based on predefined policies and learned behaviors.

Furthermore, `AILA` will serve as a bridge between users and the `KAIM`, allowing for high-level interactions and providing detailed reports, recommendations, and automated troubleshooting. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, `AILA` will adapt to different environments, making it a versatile tool for system administration across various infrastructures.

> **Summary**:
> The goal of `AILA` is to push the boundaries of autonomous system management, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven administration in complex computing environments.
